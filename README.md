# Lexical-Analyser
The main requirement of this assessment is to write a lexical analyser and recursive-descent parser for the language defined in this document.
The compile script must compile your source code and the parse script must take the name of a Boaz source file to be analysed and run your analyser on it. The marker of your work must be able to compile your code by just typing:

bash compile

and run your code by just typing:

bash parse file.boaz
